📘 aSWMultiplexer — Quick Start Guide (Updated)
This system virtualizes your load order and merges weapon, armor, keyword, and leveled‑list content at runtime using 20 fixed dummy ESPs.

✅ 1. Install and enable your original mods
- Install all mods you want included (weapons, armor, leveled lists, etc.)
- Enable them in Vortex or MO2
- Let your mod manager sort the load order
- Close the game and your mod manager

✅ 2. Export your load order and copy it next to the CSV Builder
📌 Where Vortex saves loadorder.txt
Vortex stores your load order file here:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Fallout4


Copy loadorder.txt into the same folder as csvbuilder.exe.

✅ 3. Run the CSV Builder
The tool will generate:
- loadorder_mapped_filtered_clean.csv
- slot.cfg
- worldspace_skipped.txt
- worldspace_diagnostics.txt
- mixed_records.txt
- csvbuilder.log
All written to:
Fallout 4/Data/F4SE/Plugins/Multiplexer/



✅ 4. Disable the original mods in Vortex/MO2
After generating the CSV:
- Disable only the plugins that were multiplexed
- Leave the 20 dummy ESPs enabled
- Keep the aSWMultiplexer F4SE plugin enabled
⭐ Important for StoryWealth Users
Do NOT disable the core StoryWealth collection plugins.
These include:
- Quest mods
- Framework mods
- Script‑heavy mods
- Worldspace mods
- Settlement mods
- StoryWealth‑required dependencies
Only content‑mods that were multiplexed (weapons, armor, keywords, leveled lists) should be disabled.
Everything else — especially StoryWealth’s main collection plugins — must remain active.
This ensures:
- StoryWealth continues functioning normally
- Quests and scripts remain intact
- Worldspaces remain stable
- Frameworks remain loaded
- Only safe categories are virtualized

✅ 5. Enable the Dummy Plugins
Your mod archive includes 20 empty dummy ESPs:
- 5 Weapons
- 5 Armor
- 5 Keywords
- 5 Leveled Lists
Enable all 20 in Vortex/MO2.
Load order does not matter.

✅ 6. Launch the game via F4SE
The Multiplexer will:
- Load your CSV
- Read slot.cfg
- Inject all remapped records at runtime
You now have a fully merged, ESL‑aware, compressed‑record‑compatible runtime patch.

📝 Important Notes
- Regenerate the CSV whenever you add/remove mods
- Only disable the plugins that were multiplexed
- StoryWealth’s core plugins must remain active
- Dummy ESPs must be enabled
- The Multiplexer plugin must be installed in:
Fallout 4/Data/F4SE/Plugins/
- Worldspace‑touching plugins must remain enabled normally
- Protected plugins must be listed in:
Fallout 4/Data/F4SE/Plugins/Multiplexer/extern/protected_plugins.json
