❓ Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Do I keep my original mods enabled after generating the CSV?
A: No.
Disable all original mods after generating the CSV.
The Multiplexer injects everything at runtime — the original plugins must be disabled.

Q: Why must loadorder.txt be next to csvbuilder.exe?
Because the CSV Builder only reads the load order from its own folder.
If it’s missing, the CSV will be empty or incomplete.

Q: Do the dummy ESPs need a specific load order?
No.
Dummy ESPs are virtual namespaces.
Their load order does not matter.

Q: How many dummy ESPs do I need to enable?
Exactly 20.
The Multiplexer uses a fixed set of 20 dummy plugins:
- 5 Weapons
- 5 Armor
- 5 Keywords
- 5 Leveled Lists
These must all be enabled.

Q: Do dummy ESPs count toward the plugin limit?
Yes.
Dummy ESPs are real plugin files and therefore consume plugin indices.
However:
• 	The Multiplexer uses only 20 dummy ESPs
• 	They are empty and contain no records
• 	They do not cause conflicts
• 	They do not degrade performance

Q: Does this modify my save file?
No.
All injection happens in memory at runtime.
Your save remains clean.

Q: Can I add or remove mods later?
Yes — but you must regenerate the CSV.
Any change to your mod list requires a new CSV mapping.

Q: Does this work with ESLs and compact FormIDs?
Yes.
The Multiplexer fully supports:
- ESL compact FormIDs
- FE‑range FormIDs
- Compressed records
- Creation Club ESLs
Everything is scanned and injected correctly.

Q: Does this replace a Bashed Patch or Merged Patch?
Yes, for leveled lists and keyword distribution.
No manual patching is needed.

Q: Do I need to run FO4Edit?
No.
The Multiplexer handles everything automatically.

Q: Does this work with MO2?
Yes.
Workflow is identical:
- Enable original mods
- Generate CSV
- Disable original mods
- Enable dummy ESPs
- Launch via F4SE

Q: What is protected_plugins.json?
A file that lists plugins that must never be multiplexed.
Correct path:
Fallout 4/Data/F4SE/Plugins/Multiplexer/extern/protected_plugins.json



Q: What are worldspace_skipped.txt and worldspace_diagnostics.txt?
These files list plugins that contain:
- WRLD
- CELL
- LAND
- NAVM
- REFR
- ACHR
These plugins cannot be multiplexed and must remain enabled normally.

Q: What is mixed_records.txt?
A diagnostic file listing plugins that contain multiple safe categories
(e.g., WEAP + ARMO).
These are still multiplexed normally.

⚠️ Common Mistakes (Updated)
❌ Mistake #1 — Forgetting to copy loadorder.txt next to csvbuilder.exe
Result: CSV is empty or missing mods.
Fix: Copy loadorder.txt into the CSV Builder folder.

❌ Mistake #2 — Leaving original mods enabled after CSV generation
Result: Duplicate records or conflicts.
Fix: Disable all original mods after generating the CSV.

❌ Mistake #3 — Not enabling the 20 dummy ESPs
Result: The Multiplexer has nowhere to inject records.
Fix: Enable all 20 dummy ESPs.

❌ Mistake #4 — Launching the game without F4SE
Result: The Multiplexer plugin never loads.
Fix: Always launch via f4se_loader.exe.

❌ Mistake #5 — Editing the CSV or slot.cfg manually
Result: Broken mappings or missing records.
Fix: Let the CSV Builder generate these files automatically.

❌ Mistake #6 — Adding new mods without regenerating the CSV
Result: New mods won’t be included.
Fix: Re‑run the CSV Builder whenever your mod list changes.

❌ Mistake #7 — Expecting dummy ESPs to contain data
Result: Confusion.
Fix: Dummy ESPs are intentionally empty.
All content is injected at runtime.

❌ Mistake #8 — Thinking the plugin modifies game files
Result: Unnecessary worry.
Fix: The plugin only injects data into memory.
Nothing on disk is changed.

❌ Mistake #9 — Ignoring worldspace warnings
Result: Crashes or broken worldspaces.
Fix: Any plugin listed in worldspace_skipped.txt must remain enabled normally.

❌ Mistake #10 — Forgetting protected plugins
Result: Critical mods may be multiplexed incorrectly.
Fix: Add them to:
Multiplexer/extern/protected_plugins.json
